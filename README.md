# Iterated-deletion-procedures-IDSDS
Game of theory | The  Iterated Deletion of Strictly Dominated Strategies

in  file IDSDS.java there are the main code to solve game of  three  players  by IDSDS  method
and in file players.jave there are class  help us in solve the issue

##
the payoff to eache player  in my issue was static  you can noticed that  from line  51 to 157 


##
in run you can enter 
number of players  ==> 3
stratages of eache player ==>   3

 ##
the section from line 172 to 220 is rewrite to every player with some edits  
the Boolean variable (stop) in this section help us to speed the run and decreases the complexity

##
in lines 209 - 261 - 313 we put -1 in the array that equals the delete of row or column and this
speed the run and decreases the complexity in next steps
